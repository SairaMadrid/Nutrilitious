### Notes Steph:

- Make sure you have nodemon installed globally on your system. If not, open a new terminal and run the following command: npm install -g nodemon
- Same as above for dotenv & mysql: npm install dotenv / npm install mysql
- A necessary request in the terminal to run this project: npm run migrate
